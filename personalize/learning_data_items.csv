He will be leading a live performance to teach students how to produce a video-essay. He will be showing that, in contrast to understand video essays as an explanatory representational format with which to argue an authorized knowledge about film objects in a more fitting audiovisual form this presentation wants to plea for something more radical: Video-graphic practice taken seriously as experimental research puts traditional understandings of expertise into question with severe ramification also for the system of academia as a whole, putting video essay researchers instead into the position of what Jacques Ranci&egrave;re called the &ldquo;ignorant schoolmaster&rdquo;.  Rather than mastering the audiovisual material this presentation wants to put to the test a video-graphic practice that is accentuating the accidental not only within the material to be analyzed but also in our own analytical practice.

campuspulse-i33-e8505571,1666126800000,ThoughtfulLearning|Speaker,"W. E. B. Du Bois&rsquo;s interest in and use of sources from ancient Greece and Rome has been a hot topic in recent years, evidenced by a special volume of the International Journal of the Classical Tradition (2019) and a conference held at Penn State in 2021. In the concluding essay of the former, Patrice Rankine noted &ldquo;the need to postpone the word citation, given the difficulty of locating Du Bois&rsquo;s exact sources of influence&rdquo; and the accompanying turn to Gates&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;Signifyin(g).&rdquo;  In this lecture, Sabnis uses material from W. E. B. Du Bois papers to survey Du Bois&rsquo;s citations of ancient Greece and Rome. While citations of Greek and Roman sources are minimal features within Du Bois&rsquo;s enormous oeuvre, they are prominent in his understanding of history and humanism in education. At the same time, Du Bois&rsquo;s classical references suggest an ironic relationship to the citationality of Greece and Rome in mainstream white media, one that is supported by more acerbic writings by Du Bois&rsquo;s NAACP colleague (and Yale classics major) William Pickens. Understanding Du Bois and Pickens&rsquo; particular brand of citation is important as scholars of Greece and Rome work to acknowledge and correct exclusionary practices of the past and broaden the terms of classical education.  Sonia Sabnis is Professor and Chair of Greek, Latin, and Ancient Mediterranean Studies (GLAM) at Reed College, where she has taught since 2006. She received her BA from Columbia University (1998) before completing an MA (2000) and Ph.D. (2006) at University of California, Berkeley. She is broadly interested in imperial literature, Greek and Latin, but her primary research specialty is the African Roman author Apuleius. Her published research includes studies of slavery and literature, figurative katabasis, and reception in different contexts in the twentieth and twentyfirst century, including contemporary Algerian novels, mid-century horror, and poetry in English. In addition to the Du Bois Center fellowship, she has held research fellowships at Vassar College and Wellesley College. She will be Professor-in-Charge at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome in 2024&ndash;25."
